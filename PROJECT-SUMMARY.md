# 📚 Jalees Booklist App - What I Built

## 🎯 **What This App Does (Simple Explanation)**

This is a **book recommendation website** where people can:
- Browse a collection of books
- See book details and ratings
- Read reviews from other readers
- Add their own reviews

Think of it like **Goodreads** but simpler and more beautiful!

## 🛠️ **Technologies I Used (Beginner-Friendly)**

### **Frontend (What users see in the browser)**
- **React** - A popular way to build interactive websites
- **Tailwind CSS** - A tool that makes styling easier
- **React Router** - Helps users navigate between different pages

### **Backend (The server that stores data)**
- **Node.js** - A way to run JavaScript on a server
- **Express** - A framework that makes building servers easier
- **JSON file** - A simple way to store data (like a spreadsheet)

## 🌟 **Cool Features I Added**

1. **Beautiful Design** - Glass-like cards with yellow theme
2. **Arabic Support** - Books in both English and Arabic
3. **Responsive** - Works on phones, tablets, and computers
4. **Animated Backgrounds** - Moving waves in the hero section
5. **Book Covers** - Real images for each book
6. **Review System** - Users can rate and review books
